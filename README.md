Counter-X
I developed this project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Here,
Features of normal counter is available, like increasing the value, decreasing and reseting the value.
Additional feature(activated when Game Mode" is clicked):
1. Background is changed to yellow.
2. With the increase button being clicked, balls appear.
3. Number of balls is equivalent to number of clicks on the increase button.
4. Balls travel in sinusoidal wave.
5. Deactivated when "Game mode" is clicked.
